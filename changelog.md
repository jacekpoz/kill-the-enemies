# v0.0.1
- made this changelog so if you wanna know what was going on before look at the commits (they don't go all the way back cause I was so smart back then that I didn't create the git repo)
- moving works but clunky
- there are enemies that follow you
- there are walls that you can sometimes noclip into
- there's a weapon from which you can shoot but it doesn't work yet
